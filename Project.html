<p style="color:steelblue"> Nymi is the wearable authentication technology that allows users to take control of their identity through cardiac rhythm identification. 
<br> The user simply has to wear the Nymi band, wait 20 seconds for their cardiac rhythm to be identified, encrypted and ready to use for the day. The biometric authentication is only required everytime the user removes the Nymi band.</p>

<h1 style="text-align center; color:#9999FF;">Our Project</h1>
<p style="color:steelblue"> Our app allows patients with heart conditions to monitor their heart health using the ECG produced by the Nymi band. Our app will achieve this by comparing the patients resting heart rate and sending out an alert when deviations from baseline ECG is detected indicating an abnormality. In addition, since the health of a person is also due to their lifetyle choices, our app will also allow users to track their exercise and eating habits.
This provides users with an easy to use interface that will help them make better lifestyle choices to achieve a long & healthy life.</p>
